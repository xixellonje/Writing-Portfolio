### Overview
Growing up in a Kosovan household, mantija was a staple in our meal rotation. It is a small ball of baked dough with filling inside (typically beef or cheese), and can be enjoyed at any time of the day.

### Before you begin
You will need the following utensils:
- A 40cm circular baking tin 
- A mixing bowl 
- A pan
- A rolling pin
- (Optional) A pastry wheel

And you will need the following ingredients:
- 500g of flour 
- 400g of soft cream cheese 
- 350ml of warm water
- 150g of butter 
- Salt
- Vegetable oil

## Recipe

### Step 1 - Make the dough
In your mixing bowl, mix the warm water with a teaspoon of salt and a tablespoon of vegetable oil. 
Add flour slowly to the mixture, continuing to stir until the mixture becomes too sticky to continue. 
- (This will usually take 400g of flour but can vary, so make sure you have some extra flour on standby.)

Dust your counter/workspace with a handful of flour to prevent your mixture from sticking to the surface, and place your mixture on top. Knead the mixture, adding handfuls of flour in intervals, until it becomes a slightly sticky dough.

### Step 2 - Melt your butter 
> *This step is just preparation, and can be done at any point, but is most efficient when done early.*

In a pan, mix your butter with two tablespoons of vegetable oil. Put this on your kitchen hob at a medium-high heat to melt.

You can do this simultaneously as you work on step 3, checking in intervals to make sure the butter does not burn. Once melted, take the pan off the heat and let it cool.

### Step 3 - Stretch and shape the dough
Half your dough and set one half aside. Roll the half you’re using into a long cylinder, roughly one arm span.
Break the cylinder into 10 separate balls. Then, one by one, use your rolling pin to roll each ball into thin, circular layers. 
> *Tip: As you roll these layers, you may not have enough space for all 10 to individually sit on your work surface. To keep them out of the way, place each one on top of the other in stacks of five, flouring in between each one so they do not stick to each other. This way, you should have two stacks of 5 by the end of rolling.* 

Take your pan of cooled, melted butter and *lightly* spread across the top of each layer, placing them on top of each other. Do not put butter on the top of the final layer. 

With all 10 layers in one stack, stretch out the dough by pulling the edges. You are aiming to round the edges into a wide rectangle shape. The size depends on how thick you want your mantija, but I typically go for (an admittedly eyeballed) 14 x 14 inches. 

### Step 4 - Cut and fill the dough
Using your pastry wheel (or other cutting utensil), cut the dough into equal squares, roughly 1.5 x 1.5 inches. Take your cream cheese and put a tablespoon of it in the middle of each individual square.

Once your square is filled, pick it up and pull each corner of the square in towards the middle, careful not to squash the filling. All four corners should be touching each other in the middle and covering the filling enough so that you cannot see it anymore.

Repeat for each square. They should end up looking like small round balls - that’s your mantija!

### Step 5 - Cook the mantija
Line your baking tin with the leftover melted butter, and place your mantija balls next to each other in the tin. They do not need space to cook, so feel free to push them right next to each other to get the most you can into your tin.

Set the tin aside, and repeat steps 3 and 4 for the other half of your dough.

Once all the mantija is in the tin, lightly brush the top with some of the leftover melted butter. Place in the oven at 180 degrees (Fan) - no preheating is required - and cook for 50 minutes
- After 30 minutes, rotate the tin, and then cook for a further 20 minutes. 

### Step 6 - Serve and eat!
After 50 minutes take the tray out and let it cool before serving. You can accompany mantija with side dishes such as feta cheese or peppers.

> *Tip: When taking the mantija out of the oven, wet your hand with cold water and lightly sprinkle over the entire tray. Cover the tray with a tea towel and let it rest for 5 minutes. Doing this will give you a more golden, crispy top of the mantija.*

By following this recipe, you will have made traditional Kosovan cheese mantija. Once comfortable, you can move on to more complex fillings, such as beef.
