# Writing-Portfolio
This repository contains a collection of my technical writing samples. 

Not every sample will be technical/software-themed, but all samples are written in Markdown and follow technical writing principles.

I am self-taught and currently using the following sources to improve my writing:

- https://www.thegooddocsproject.dev/
- https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/
